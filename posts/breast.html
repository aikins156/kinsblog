                            <p>The Journal of the American Medical Association published a research in
                                 January 2003 that suggested obesity may reduce life expectancy, particularly in young
                                  individuals. Body-Mass Index (BMI) and longevity were evaluated by the researchers, who 
                                  discovered a link between higher BMIs and early mortality. For instance, it was calculated that
                                   a 20-year-old white male who was 5'10" and weighed 288 pounds and had a BMI of greater than 40 would 
                                   lose 13 years of his life as a result of being obese. Although this study focused on extreme cases of 
                                   obesity, Jamie McManus, M.D., F.A.A.F.P., author of "Your Personal Guide to Wellness," points out that
                                    millions of overweight people live three to five years shorter than persons of healthy weight in 
                                    wealthy nations. She additionally predicts In America, there are 600,000 deaths annually attributed 
                                    to obesity.   
                            </p>
                            <p>How exactly can fat reduce our lifespan? Although there is an obvious connection between 
                                obesity and the emergence of cancer, the solution to this question is complex. Obesity 
                                dramatically raised the risk of cancer forming in the following organs: breast, colon, ovaries, 
                                uterus, pancreas, kidneys, and gallbladder, according to a large study by the American Cancer Institute 
                                encompassing 750,000 participants. 
                            </p>
                            <p>According to Michael Thun, MD, vice president of epidemiology and surveillance research 
                                for the American Cancer Society (ACS), one reason why obesity may increase the risk of 
                                developing cancer is because fat cells produce a type of estrogen called estradiol, which
                                 encourages rapid cell division and raises the possibility of a genetic error at an 
                                 unplanned time during cell replication that can result in cancer. Additionally, 
                                 abdominal fat may increase blood levels of insulin and insulin-like growth factors, 
                                 which may raise the chance of developing cancer. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                According to Thun, obese men and women both have a 40% greater relative risk of colon
                                 cancer and a 50% higher relative risk of breast cancer, respectively, after menopause. 
                                 For obese people, the risks of gallbladder and endometrial cancer are five times higher. 
                                 There is evidence that cancer rates in developed nations are rising 5–15 times more quickly than 
                                 those in underdeveloped nations. Diet has been shown to play a significant role in this concerning reality. 
                                 In contrast to the traditional Western diet of fatty meats, processed flours, oils, and sugars, the risk 
                                 of cancer is significantly lower in populations where the diet consists primarily of fresh fruit and vegetables
                                  and whole grains.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It appears that nutrition has its most important effects after the cancer has already grown, 
                                operating to hinder or accelerate that cancer's growth, according to Dr. David Heber, M.D., Ph.D.,
                                 author of "What Color is Your Diet," which examines the relationship between diet and the 
                                 development of cancer. The normal Western diet that causes obesity may actually operate to 
                                 encourage the growth of cancer cells, at the risk of oversimplifying a complicated series of 
                                 relationships. It is never too late to adopt a healthier lifestyle and eat more nutrient-dense 
                                 foods to improve your health. Here are some easy steps you may do to boost your health and vitality 
                                 right away.
                            </p>
                            <p>1. Calculate your BMI to see if your weight has become a health risk. 60% of Americans, 
                                or those with a BMI (a measure of a person's weight in relation to their height), are 
                                overweight, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of those, 27%
                                 have a body mass index of 30 or more and are considered obese. Only 15% of Americans 
                                 were deemed fat in 1980. The website listed below allows you to calculate your BMI.
                            </p>
                            <p>2. Align your diet with your body's needs. You will gain weight if you consume more
                                 calories than your body needs. Make recipes leaner, learn to manage your portion 
                                 sizes, and avoid eating at fast food joints regularly. Additionally, learn how to 
                                 choose healthy snacks.
                            </p>
                            <p>3. Include a wide range of colorful, cancer-preventing fruits and vegetables in your diet.
                                 There are seven different color ranges for both fruit and vegetables, and by selecting 5
                                  to 9 daily serves from a variety of them, we increase our intake of nutrients that fight 
                                  cancer (and other diseases).</p>
                              <p>4. Include a lean protein in each meal. Protein sends a strong signal to the brain that
                                 prolongs the feeling of fullness. The correct protein source is vital to maintain your lean 
                                 muscle mass and to help you control your hunger while consuming less calories. The white meat
                                  of chicken and turkey, seafood including shrimp, prawns, scallops, and lobster, ocean fish, and
                                   soy-based meat replacements are all good options for protein. Vegetarians may also choose these
                                    options.</p> 
                                  <p>5. Increase your metabolism by getting active. Exercise is a crucial component if
                                     you want to live a lifetime of wellbeing. Adults should engage in daily activity that requires 
                                     at least as much effort as a brisk walk for 30 minutes, according to Colleen Doyle, MS, RD, 
                                     director of nutrition and physical activity at the American Cancer Society (ACS). Every day, 
                                     kids should be active for one hour. We are more inclined to form habits around the things we enjoy doing,
                                      therefore look for activities you will enjoy. Additionally, it is beneficial to incorporate physical activity 
                                      into your daily routine. For example, take the stairs at work rather than the escalator or lift, park your car 
                                      in the parking space that is farthest from the super supermarket, and avoid using the remote control to change
                                       TV channels.</p>  
                                       <p>6. Enlist assistance to make sure you create a healthy eating plan and achieve your target weight.
                                         Many obese people have strong beliefs and routines about the food they eat, yet only a small fraction
                                          of people have the discipline to lose weight. Most people respond well to some kind of constant coaching
                                           and encouragement when trying to develop new behaviors. According to the results of a study titled "Effects
                                            of Internet Behavioral Counseling on Weight Loss in Adults at Risk of Type 2 Diabetes," participants who
                                             received weight loss 
                                             coaching lost more weight than those who didn't. According to the study, having a 
                                             weight loss coach at your side can greatly enhance your weight loss efforts.
                                             </p>  
                                          <p>The most preventable main risk factor for acquiring cancer has been found as being
                                             overweight or obese, second only to smoking. It has been demonstrated that even modest
                                              weight loss has positive impacts on health. Therefore, you can start at any time and you
                                               can never be too young or elderly to care about your health and take action to get to a
                                                more healthy weight.</p>
